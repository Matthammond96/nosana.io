Nosana is a platform that can help you implement automated testing using the power of blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that creates a distributed ledger of transactions that is secure, transparent, and immutable. By using blockchain, Nosana can run your tests on a network of nodes that execute them in a decentralized and trustless way. This means you don’t have to rely on any third-party servers or services to run your tests! You can also avoid any single point of failure or censorship that might affect your test results. You can also track and audit your test performance and quality over time on the blockchain, share your test results with anyone you want, or keep them private if you prefer. Nosana leverages blockchain technology to make your automated testing more efficient, reliable, and innovative.

But what exactly is automated testing, and how does it work? Let’s take a closer look at this topic.

### What is automated testing?
Automated testing is the application of software tools to automate the human-driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product. Automated testing helps you ensure your app or website works well, runs fast, and doesn’t crash or break. But testing can also be a pain in the neck. It can take a lot of time, money, and effort to do it manually. And sometimes, you might miss some bugs or errors that can ruin your reputation and frustrate your customers.
That’s why automated testing with CI/CD is the best solution for your software development process. With automated testing, you can integrate your code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy your software faster and more reliably.

### What are the types of automated testing?
There are many types of automated testing that you can use for different purposes and scenarios. Here are some of the most common ones:

* **Smoke testing:** The software undergoes a basic type of testing to check its readiness for further testing. It verifies that the main features are working and that there are no major errors or crashes.
Unit testing: A type of testing that checks the functionality of individual units or components of the software. It helps you isolate and fix any bugs or defects in your code logic.

* **Integration testing:** A type of testing that checks how different units or components work together as a whole. It helps you identify any issues or conflicts between them.

* **Regression testing:** A type of testing that checks if the software still works after any changes or updates are made. You can use it to make sure that the modifications don’t introduce any new bugs.

* **Performance testing:** A type of testing that checks how well the software performs under different loads and stress conditions. It helps you measure speed and scalability and allows you to see where the bottlenecks are in your application.

* **Security testing:** A type of testing that checks how secure the software is from malicious attacks or unauthorized access. It helps you protect your data and users from hackers and cybercriminals.

These are just some types of automated testing that you can use for your software project. Depending on your needs and goals, you can choose the ones that suit you best.

### How do you implement automated testing with CI/CD?
To implement automated testing with CI/CD, you need to follow some best practices and steps. Here are some of them:
Establish your testing strategy: Have a clear understanding of your project’s testing plan. This may involve defining the appropriate testing frameworks and tools to use, as well as specifying the types of tests that need to be performed, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

* **Analyze your tests:** Use different methods to evaluate your tests. When you monitor your automated tests’ performance over time, you can spot patterns and trends. This can show you which parts of your tests are consistently passing or failing, so you can focus on those. Checking the coverage of your automated tests ensures that all the necessary features and sections of your application have been tested. You can then prioritize creating new tests for the areas that have not been thoroughly tested yet. Track how long your automated tests take to complete, identifying the ones that consume too much of your time. This is useful for pinpointing where your test automation process is lagging and making adjustments to improve efficiency. You can then assess the quality and productivity of your test automation process according to KPIs like code coverage, test execution time, and test pass/fail rates. It is also recommended to review test logs to identify the root causes of test failures and address any issues with the test automation system. To make sure your tests are up to par and serving the objectives of your business, it’s important to conduct regular audits of your test automation process.

* **Execute smaller tests first:** You should prioritize simpler test cases and execute them first, as they will likely run faster than more complex ones. By doing so, you can test each case on its own and make sure it is covered and works well after functionality testing. Such testing will help you avoid any errors or bugs that might affect the functionality of your software.

* **Use version control:** Using a version control system is a fundamental step in the test automation process. You need it, especially if you are working with a larger team. It will help your team collaborate and integrate the different versions of the source code into one cohesive working state.

* **Automate the build:** Another significant step before you can automate your tests is to automate your builds. It is essential to have a standardized process with which you can create reproducible builds of your software. A mature build process should have all the dependencies needed to execute the build.

* **Early and frequent commits:** With continuous integration, developers are encouraged to commit their code changes frequently - at least once a day as a rule of thumb. Sharing code with the rest of the team regularly not only ensures everyone is building on the same foundation, but also results in faster code reviews and makes it easier to integrate changes.

* **Run automated tests in parallel:** One of the ways to improve your test execution time is to run automated tests in parallel on multiple devices and browsers. This allows you to test more features in less time and ensure compatibility across different platforms. By running tests in parallel, you can also reduce the risk of flaky tests and increase the reliability of your test results.

* **Use continuous feedback:** Automated testing helps you reduce the time between developing a feature and validating it. You can get immediate feedback on its functionality and quality from automated tests. You can also get feedback from other sources, such as code reviews, user feedback, analytics, etc. Such feedback will help you detect and resolve any issues early in the development process and improve your code quality and functionality.

These are some of the best practices and steps for implementing automated testing with CI/CD. By following them, you can make your software development process more efficient, reliable, and agile.
