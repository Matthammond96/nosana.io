DevOps is a popular and effective approach to software development and delivery that combines culture, processes, and tools to enable faster, more reliable, and more secure software releases. DevOps can help organizations achieve various benefits, such as:
* Reduced time-to-market and increased customer satisfaction
* Improved collaboration and alignment across teams and functions
* Enhanced quality and performance of software products and services
* Increased innovation and business value
* Reduced costs and risks

However, adopting DevOps is not a simple or straightforward task. It requires a significant amount of change and improvement in the way organizations design, develop, test, deploy, operate, and monitor software. It also requires a continuous learning and feedback loop to ensure that the DevOps practices are aligned with the changing needs and expectations of customers, stakeholders, and the market.

To understand the current state of DevOps practices and the challenges faced by DevOps practitioners, the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) conducted a global survey of nearly 26,000 DevOps professionals in collaboration with SlashData. The survey revealed some interesting insights and findings about the adoption and maturity of DevOps practices.

## Key Findings of the Survey
The survey found that:
* 84% of respondents are involved in some type of DevOps activity. This shows that DevOps is widely recognized and adopted as a valuable approach to software development and delivery. However, only 49% of respondents are using a continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) tooling platforms. 
* Moreover, only 22% of respondents are using CI/CD approaches to automate all building, testing, and deployment of code in a production environment. This means that most respondents are still relying on manual or semi-automated processes for software delivery. This can lead to delays, errors, inconsistencies, and vulnerabilities in software releases.
* The number of developers using CI/CD platforms only increased two percentage points year-over-year. This indicates that the adoption of CI/CD platforms is slow and stagnant. One possible reason for this is the use of self-hosted CI/CD tools. The survey found that the use of self-hosted CI/CD tools dropped from 32% in the first quarter of 2022 to 23% in the same period this year. Self-hosted CI/CD tools can be costly, complex, and insecure to maintain and update.
* Only 7% of respondents this year described themselves as DevOps engineers or specialists. This suggests that DevOps is still not seen as a distinct role or career path by most respondents. Instead, DevOps is seen as a set of practices that can be performed by different roles such as developers, testers, operators, etc.
* Small businesses and large enterprises are both just over 90% involved in DevOps practices, with medium-sized businesses having the highest involvement (94%). DevOps is not limited to any specific size or type of organization. However, different sizes of organizations may face different challenges and opportunities when adopting DevOps practices.
* More than three-quarters of developers (79%) are now using DevOps practices. This shows that developers are embracing DevOps as a way to improve their productivity, creativity, and satisfaction.
* Monitoring software or infrastructure performance is the most frequent DevOps activity (47%), then application security testing, using CI to build and test code, tied at 37% each, and approving code deployments into production environments, at 36%. DevOps practitioners are concerned with various aspects of software quality, such as performance, security, and reliability.

## Challenges and Recommendations

To set yourself up for success, choose a CI/CD platform that suits your needs and goals. There are many CI/CD platforms available on the market, but not all of them are suitable for every organization or every project. Factors to consider are cost, performance, security, scalability, compatibility, and usability when deciding on a CI/CD platform. Look for a CI/CD platform that supports DevOps principles and practices, such as collaboration, automation, measurement, and feedback.

Automate as much as possible in your software delivery process. Automation can help you reduce manual errors, inconsistencies, and vulnerabilities in your software releases. It can also help you save time, money, and resources. You should aim to automate all building, testing, and deployment of code in a production environment using CI/CD approaches. Also automate other aspects of your software delivery process, such as configuration management, security testing, performance monitoring, etc.

Develop a DevOps culture and mindset in your organization. DevOps is not only about tools and processes but also about culture and mindset. You should foster a culture of collaboration, communication, trust, and learning among your teams and functions. Adopting a mindset of continuous improvement, experimentation, and feedback in your software delivery process is key as well, by involving all the relevant stakeholders in your DevOps journey, such as developers, testers, operators, security experts, business analysts, customers, etc.

Measuring and monitoring your DevOps performance and outcomes is essential for assessing and improving your DevOps practices. To quantify and track your DevOps performance and outcomes, some common metrics to use are DevOps are deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, change failure rate, customer satisfaction, etc. Data and evidence should drive the decision-making and improvement actions in your DevOps process.

### How to Achieve DevOps Maturity with Nosana
One of the key challenges of adopting DevOps is finding the right tools and platforms that can support DevOps principles and practices. There are many tools and platforms available on the market, but not all of them are suitable for every organization or every project. Thatâ€™s why we created Nosana, a decentralized platform that can help you implement DevOps using the power of blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that creates a distributed ledger of transactions that is secure, transparent, and immutable. Nosana leverages blockchain to provide you with a trustless, resilient, and private platform for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

#### What is Nosana?
Nosana is a decentralized platform that runs CI/CD pipelines on top of the Solana blockchain. Solana is a high-performance blockchain that can process thousands of transactions per second with low fees and high security. Nosana uses Solana to provide you with a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective platform for CI/CD.
Nosana enables you to create your own CI/CD pipelines using simple YAML. You can define your workflows using commands or scripts that run inside containers. Containers are isolated environments that contain all the tools and dependencies that are needed to run your pipeline tasks. You can use any image that suits your needs or create your own custom image.

You can run your workflows on the Nosana network. The Nosana network is a network of nodes that provide computation power for running CI/CD pipelines. You can use the Nosana network to run your pipeline tasks in a decentralized way, without relying on any centralized service or provider. This gives you extra resilience, security, and privacy for your CI/CD pipelines. With the integration of CI/CD jobs and the blockchain, you can create a chain of hashes to be able to prove which runner did a certain job to create a certain artifact. For example, you can figure out exactly which computer ran a CI/CD job to publish the latest version of your Rust crate, which creates even more transparency in how software is built and distributed to the masses.

If you are interested in using Nosana for CI/CD, you can visit our website https://nosana.io/ or our documentation https://docs.nosana.io/ to learn more. You can also try it out now for free and see for yourself how Nosana can help you achieve DevOps maturity.
