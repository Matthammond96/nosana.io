We help DevOps teams to build software faster, more cost-effective and secure. We’re the only decentralized CI/CD platform, powered by the <a href="https://solana.com/" target="_blank">Solana Network</a>, and fueled by the NOS token.


To build great projects, you’ll need great software. No matter the size of your open source project, CI/CD automation should play a central role in your development. The number of open source projects is growing every day, in crypto and beyond, and the need for DevOps tooling is greater than ever. Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest growing ecosystem in crypto, with over 400 projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and more. As a result, we have chosen Solana to power our CI/CD solution. Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network to build out decentralized software pipelines.

Start using Nosana  pipelines for your crypto and open source projects. Our community-driven platform accelerates software development immensely. The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into a CI/CD marketplace. The NOS token lives in the centre, incentivizing CI/CD artifacts. Developers & supporters can use and share each other's compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines. Support others by running code checks or build container images and get NOS tokens in return. No technological knowledge is required, only a strong belief in the projects of our open source and crypto community. Use this power to your advantage as a developer and use Nosana nodes to run your pipelines on demand. CI by the people, for the people!
